# Developer tips:
#   - CRA = Code Risk Analyzer (more info on CRA: https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/code-risk-analyzer-cli-plugin?topic=code-risk-analyzer-cli-plugin-cra-cli-plugin)
#   - Multiple directories can be scanned by CRA. Ensure if there are any deployable architecture in the repository that they are all scanned
#   - More info about supported configurations at https://github.com/terraform-ibm-modules/common-pipeline-assets/blob/main/.github/workflows/terraform-test-pipeline.md#cra-config-yaml
